Elli: But who did you invite?
Sophie smiles embarrassed
Lisa and Alli: Oh … my … god … (they take three steps backwards)
Lisa: You didn’t invite them both, did you?
Sophie: Somehow, I have to find out who my father is and I really want him to walk me down the aisle.
Elli: What would you write to a total stranger? (mockingly)“Please come to my wedding, you might be my father”?

Sophie: They think my mum sent the invitations and with what’s in here… (points on the diary) no surprise they said yes!
Elli: but which one will take you to the altar?
Sophie: I don’t know – I guess we’ll find out when I see them.
Sky walks in – Sophie signals the others to be quiet.
Lisa: (to Sky) Are you excited about the wedding?
Sky: (unconvinced) Oh yes!
Sophie: Oh yes… If you had your way, it would be a three minute thing in jeans and t-shirt washed down in a bottle of beer.
Sky: You make me seem so unromantic. I just thought we should save our money for travelling.
Sophie: Well, we’re not going anywhere now! Anyway, please leave, we are very, very busy.
Sky: Okay, okay, I’m already gone. Leaves stage
Elli: Why haven’t you told him you’ve invited your dads?

Sophie: Because he’d say that I’d have to tell mum.

After the Song Donna goes to her bedroom and falls on her bed. She starts to cry. Rosy and Tanja come in.

Tanja: And you will be fine on your own. (laughing)

Donna: No it is not that. He is here, Sophie’s Dad is here!

Rosy: You finally found out who he is? Tell me! Who is it?

Donna: I don’t know. The summer I got pregnant, there were 3 guys visiting the Island. It could be all of them. When I got to the Island, there was Bill with his boat. He offered me a ride, but it just did not work out. Sam. He was amazing but engaged and had to go back Home. 

Rosy: Do they know about Sophie?

Donna: Of course not! I never told a soul.

Tanja: Donna! Keeping it to yourself all these years.

Donna: It doesn’t matter to me. Sophie can’t find out!
Tanja: Maybe she would be cool with it?

Donna: No No No, this would be like a bombshell for her!

Rosy: You Need to calm down! (Grabs Donnas shoulder to Support her)

Donna: I dont know Why they are here! And I have brought this all to myself, because I was stupid and slept with Both of them within 2 weeks!

Rosy and Tanja together: You sound like your mother! (Laughing)

Donna: No, I don’t!

Rosy: Yes You do! You have been living like a nun. Whatever happened to our Donna!

Tanja: Life and soul of a Party! Come on!

Donna: I grew up

Tanja: Then grow back down again!

Sophie: I don’t know… maybe I should call off the wedding.
Lisa sighs
Lisa: Sophie, do you love Sky?

Sophie; Yeah, but what if it doesn’t work out? And what about the mess I made by inviting my potential dads?
Lisa puts a hand on her shoulder, squeezing it lightly
Elli: You worry too much. Sky loves you, it will work out. And about your dads, we will sort that out another time. Now let’s go inside, have a drink … or a couple of drinks … and just enjoy the party.
Lisa takes Sophie’s hand and drags her inside. Elli tags along.
Lisa: Come on, let’s get a drink. 

Sophie: Are you sure?

Lisa: Yes, I am sure! You’re getting married! We have to celebrate.
Elli: Sophie, stop being such a party pooper and start having some fun!

Donna: Hey, don‘t you have to get ready. Where are Ali and Lisa? Didn‘t they want to help you?“
Sophie: Can you get me ready?
Donna: Yes ,of course honey.
Sophie runs to the chair in the middle of the stage. Donna walks behind.
Donna: Sophie wait. All right. It‘s all right. We have time.
Slipping through my fingers plays. Donna styles Sophie‘s hair. Donna gets emotional. Music stops playing and Sophie thinks of something.
Sophie: Do you feel left alone by me?
Donna: How do you come up with something like that? 
Sophie: Because you have achieved so much. I mean raising a child, running a hotel alone. 
Donna:  You know darling, I had no other choice. I couldn't go home anymore. When my mother found out that I was pregnant with you, she told me not to come home anymore. And I would never have wanted it any other way. Do you realize how nice we had it?
Sophie: Will you lead me to the altar?
Donna: Yes. 
Both are getting emotional. They start to sing a part of Slipping through my fingers and end the song. Lisa and Elli take Sophie away from stage. 
### Scene 8
Donna is standing on the cliff crying, you can hear the sound of the sea. Donna wants to go up the way, then Sam comes running towards her.
Sam: Donna, I need to talk to you about who is giving Sophie away.
Donna: Her Dad isn‘t here!

Sam: She told me she wants her father here… Donna listen to me!.. This is about us!
Donna is singing the Song ,, The Winner takes it all‘‘
Sam doesn‘t know how to react and sits down and listens to her carefully.
Then there is a short break in singing and Donna runs up the stairs to the church.
Sam: DONNA!

Donna looks down at Sam from above and sings the phrase “The Winner Takes it All‘‘. Both leave the stage in different directions.
### Scene 9
Setting: A sunny Greek island. The wedding altar Sophie stands nervously in her wedding dress, with is beautifully decorated with white flowers and greenery.
Sky by her side. The guests are there, and there is a tense
but excited atmosphere. But as the moment comes for Sophie and Sky to say “I do,” things take a surprising turn. Sophie stands at the altar and next to her mother and the two men who Sophie believes might be her father.
Sophie: I... I can’t do this, Sky. I thought I was ready, but... it just doesn’t feel right. I’m sorry... I’m really sorry to the both of you.
Sky: Sophie... what are you saying? We were about to get married. Isn’t this our moment?
Sophie:Yeah, but it’s also the moment when I need to figure out the truth... about myself, about us... and about my family.
The guests start whispering. Donna looks at Sophie, then at the three men.
Donna: Sophie... what do you mean? What’s going on?
Sophie: I thought I had to choose which one of you is my dad. But maybe I don’t have to choose. (pauses and looks at her mother) And you... You never thought about how hard this has been for me, did you?
Donna: Sophie... what are you saying?
Sophie: I always thought I had to have the perfect family a clear answer to who my father is. But life isn’t that simple. You’re both a part of me and what we’re doing right now... this isn’t the right way.
Sam: Sophie, I... I’m sorry if I made you feel like you had to choose. You’re our daughter you don’t have to pick.
Bill: Exactly. We’re here because we love you, Sophie. You don’t have to pick.
Sophie looks at all three of her fathers, then at Sky. She feels torn.
Sophie: I love you all so much. But this...This isn’t what I really want. I don’t want to get married yet.
Sky: (sighs) Sophie... I understand. Maybe we were rushing it. Maybe we need some time to figure out what we really want.
Donna steps forward, her eyes filled with tears. She looks at Sophie.
Donna: Sophie... you’re the strongest person I know. And if you feel this way, then we all have to respect that. (looks at the men) But if I’m being honest... I also have a decision to make.
Sam: What do you mean, Donna?
Donna:(a small smile starts to form) Sam... You’re the man I want to share my life with. It was never the right time... but now, I know that this is the right moment.
Sam:(surprised, then smiles) Donna... really?
Donna: Yes, really. I love you, Sam. I’ve always loved you, even when I didn’t show it. Now it’s the time for us to build a future together.
Bill, who has been quietly watching the conversation, smiles and nods approvingly.
Bill: (softly) It’s okay, Donna. I’m happy for both of you. You belong together.
Sophie looks at her mother and then at Sky. She feels a little relieved, but also sad. She turns to Sky.
Sophie: I love you all so much. But I know now that it’s okay to follow my own path. Im not ready to get married yet. I want to find myself before making that decision.
Sky: I get it, Sophie. Maybe we’re just not at that point yet. But I’ll wait for you. We have our whole lives ahead of us.
Donna and Sam look into each other’s eyes, and it’s clear that they’ve found each other again.
Sam:(smiling at Donna) Donna...will you marry me?
All guests are positively shocked and Donna’s friends raise their hands to their mouth
Donna:(smiling, her eyes shining) Yes, Sam. I’ll marry you.
The guests start clapping as Donna and Sam share a kiss. Sophie watches , a small smile on her face , as Sky stands by her side

Sophie: This is the happy ending we all needed.
Sky: Yeah. And who knows what the future holds.
Sophie and Sky walk away from the altar together hand in hand. Bill watches Donna and Sam being happy together and nods, smiling at them. “Voulez-Vous” is played.
